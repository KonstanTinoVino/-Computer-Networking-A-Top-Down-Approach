Implementation of Stop and Wait TCP protocol via HTTP
=======================
This is a custom assignment where I implement the different versions of the Stop and Wait protocol as described
in the book (chapter 3.4.1). I am using HTTP to transfer the packet objects between a localhost client and server so
as to simulate the exchange of information.
